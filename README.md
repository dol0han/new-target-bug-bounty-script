# Bug-Bounty-Enumation-w-ZSH
Simple bugBounty enum script scripted in ZSH utilizing Subfinder, Amass, Nmap, HTTProbe and a few other simple commands to gather and combine lists of sub-domains, check for activity, then scan for open ports. Will be organizing the output a little better and adding 'Automated' Vulnerability scanning as well in the coming few days.'
